# Creative Coding First Assignment
Homework 1: Point, Line, Plane and Pseudo-Randomness.



## 🖥️ Description
This project explores generative art inspired by Kandinsky, using points, lines, and planes.
It combines randomness and order to create a generative artwork that expresses rhythm and pauses through these elements, 
and translates sound into a visual form of energy.


## 📌 Features
- Gradient background (top → mid → bottom colors)
- Central isosceles triangle with color fading
- Randomly generated large triangles and circles with halo effects
- Crossing lines, arcs, and hatching lines
- Semi-circles in sequence
- Randomly scattered small triangles and circles
- A big halo circle with layered outline
- Checkerboard and hashboard patterns
- Wavy line shapes with varying thickness

## 🖱 Interaction
- **Mouse click**: Regenerates a new composition with a different random seed.
- **Key press**: Press `c` or `C` to shuffle the color palette.
